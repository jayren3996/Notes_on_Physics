	abstract = {The emergence of statistical mechanics for isolated classical systems comes about through chaotic dynamics and ergodicity. Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.}

@article{puremeasure-1,
	abstract = {Random quantum circuits, in which an array of qubits is subjected to a series of randomly chosen unitary operations, have provided key insights into the dynamics of many-body quantum entanglement. Recent work has shown that interleaving the unitary operations with single-qubit measurements can drive a transition between high- and low-entanglement phases. Here we study a class of symmetric random quantum circuits with two competing types of measurement in addition to unitary dynamics. We find a rich phase diagram involving robust symmetry-protected topological, trivial and volume law entangled phases, where the transitions are hidden to expectation values of any operator and are only apparent by averaging the entanglement entropy over quantum trajectories. In the absence of unitary dynamics, we find a purely measurement-induced critical point, which maps exactly to two copies of a classical two-dimensional percolation problem. Numerical simulations indicate that this transition is a tricritical point that splits into two critical lines in the presence of arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics with an intervening volume law entangled phase. Our results show that measurements alone are sufficient to induce criticality and logarithmic entanglement scaling, and arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics can be sufficient to stabilize volume law entangled phases in the presence of rapid, yet competing, measurements.},

  abstract="In this chapter, we introduce the theory of measurements in continuous time (diffusive case) starting from the particular but important case of complete observation. This allows to present the Hilbert space formulation of the theory, where the state of the observed quantum system is described by a vector in the Hilbert space H of the system. Even if this is a special case of the more general theory presented in Chap. 3, 4 and 5, it deserves a separate treatment for different reasons: it is instructive, it uses only the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, it is of interest on its own because the stochastic Scr{\"o}dinger equation presented in this chapter has also been used in different contexts [1--6], some mathematical results of the following chapter will relay anyhow on the theory presented here, and Hilbert space SDEs are the key starting point for efficient numerical simulations of the dynamics of open quantum systems [1, 7].",

  abstract = {We review recent progress on constructing non-equilibrium steady state density operators of boundary driven locally interacting quantum chains, where driving is implemented via Markovian dissipation channels attached to the chain’s ends. We discuss explicit solutions in three different classes of quantum chains, specifically, the paradigmatic (anisotropic) Heisenberg spin- chain, the Fermi–Hubbard chain, and the Lai–Sutherland spin-1 chain, and discuss universal concepts which characterize these solutions, such as matrix product ansatz and a more structured walking graph state ansatz. The central theme is the connection between the matrix product form of nonequilibrium states and the integrability structures of the bulk Hamiltonian, such as the Lax operators and the Yang–Baxter equation. However, there is a remarkable distinction with respect to the conventional quantum inverse scattering method, namely addressing nonequilibrium steady state density operators requires non-unitary irreducible representations of Yang–Baxter algebra which are typically of infinite dimensionality. Such constructions result in non-Hermitian, and often also non-diagonalisable families of commuting transfer operators which in turn result in novel conservation laws of the integrable bulk Hamiltonians. For example, in the case of the anisotropic Heisenberg model, quasi-local conserved operators which are odd under spin reversal (or spin flip) can be constructed, whereas the conserved operators stemming from orthodox Hermitian transfer operators (via logarithmic differentiation) are all even under spin reversal.}

  abstract = "{This book treats the central physical concepts and mathematical techniques used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum systems. To provide a self-contained presentation, the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation and on the formulation of generalized measurement theory through quantum operations and effects. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.}",

@article{mps-1,
	abstract = {We study a construction that yields a class of translation invariant states on quantum spin chains, characterized by the property that the correlations across any bond can be modeled on a finite-dimensional vector space. These states can be considered as generalized valence bond states, and they are dense in the set of all translation invariant states. We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic ``N{\'e}el ordered''states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as ``local functions''of states of a special kind, so-called ``purely generated states,''which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range VBS interactions. We show that all these generalized VBS models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group. In particular we illustrate our results with a one-parameter family of examples which are not isotropic except for one special case. This isotropic model coincides with the one-dimensional antiferromagnet, recently studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki.},
